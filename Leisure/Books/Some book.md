## Background

Here I tend to write the background of the book, how did I know about it, what was the markable moments connected to it.

Also could describe main thoughts of the book. If that is fictional book, it could be a quick plot summary, otherwise just some core moments and ideas.

## Review

My thoughts and comments on the book overall or specific place in it. I might like the book, but was outraged by some decision or idea.

## Key Takeaways

- Idea
- Quote
