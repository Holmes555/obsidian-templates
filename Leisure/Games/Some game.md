## Background

Here I tend to write the background of the game, how did I know about it, what was the markable moments connected to it.

Also could describe main thoughts of the idea and gameplay of the game. Maybe some plot if there was any.

## Review

My thoughts and comments on the game overall or specific place in it. It could be emotional feedback or more engineering one: like what game design elements I liked/disliked, what could I've done better.
